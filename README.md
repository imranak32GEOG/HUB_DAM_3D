HUB DAM Bathymetry and Volume Analysis Using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python

This project provides tools for analyzing the bathymetry and calculating the volume of a hub dam, 
with additional functionality to visualize and smooth terrain data in 3D. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for remote sensing data, 
and Python for data processing and visualization, the code demonstrates techniques for calculating lake area, volume estimation, and bathymetric mapping.
